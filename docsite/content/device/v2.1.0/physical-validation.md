# UART Development Testing on Nucleo Boards

> Source snapshot: [docs/PHYSICAL_TESTING.md](https://github.com/w1ne/iolinki/blob/ad892f43fa7292cb3d4ccf60410f5541a0d0a5ca/docs/PHYSICAL_TESTING.md), `ad892f43fa72`.


This guide tests a logic-level UART transport. It does not validate a 24 V IO-Link
line, a transceiver, or interoperability with a commercial IO-Link master. For the
new portable transceiver implementation, see [TIOL112 integration](tiol112.md).

This guide explains how to set up and run the IO-Link stack on two Nucleo L476RG boards using a UART-based physical layer simulation.

## Prerequisites

- 2x **Nucleo L476RG** boards
- 3x Jumper wires (Female-Female or Male-Female depending on headers)
- Micro-USB cables for both boards
- Host computer with Zephyr SDK and `west` installed

## Wiring

Since we are simulating the IO-Link physical layer using UART, we need to cross-connect the TX and RX lines between the two boards.

**Connection Diagram:**

| Board A (Master/Device) | Connection | Board B (Device/Master) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **GND** (CN7 Pin 20 or CN6 Pin 6) | <--> | **GND** |
| **UART TX** (PA9 / D8) | <--> | **UART RX** (PA10 / D2) |
| **UART RX** (PA10 / D2) | <--> | **UART TX** (PA9 / D8) |

> **Note:** on Nucleo L476RG, `usart1` is typically available on pins D8 (PA9) and D2 (PA10). Double-check your specific board's pinout if communication fails. The default configuration uses the standard Zephyr pin mapping for `usart1`.

## Quick Start (Automated)

I've consolidated the automation scripts into the `examples/zephyr_app/scripts/` directory:

1.  **Fix USB Permissions** (Run once):
    ```bash
    ./examples/zephyr_app/scripts/fix_usb_perms.sh
    newgrp plugdev
    ```

2.  **Build and Flash Both Boards**:
    ```bash
    ./examples/zephyr_app/scripts/setup_and_flash.sh
    ```

3.  **Monitor the Test**:
    ```bash
    python3 examples/zephyr_app/scripts/monitor_nucleos.py
    ```

## Manual Build and Flash

The application is configured to use the UART PHY by default when building for this board (via `prj.conf` and `nucleo_l476rg.overlay`).

1.  **Build for Nucleo L476RG:**

    ```bash
    west build -p always -b nucleo_l476rg examples/zephyr_app
    ```

2.  **Flash Board A:**
    Connect Board A via USB.

    ```bash
    west flash
    ```

3.  **Flash Board B:**
    Connect Board B via USB (and disconnect Board A to avoid confusion, or specify serial number).

    ```bash
    west flash
    ```

## Running the Test

1.  Open a serial terminal for Board A (e.g., `minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0`).
2.  Open a serial terminal for Board B (e.g., `minicom -D /dev/ttyACM1`).
3.  Reset both boards.

### Expected Output

You should see logs indicating the IO-Link stack initialization and the use of the UART PHY:

```text
[00:00:00.000,000] <inf> iolink_demo: Starting IO-Link Zephyr Demo
[00:00:00.000,000] <inf> iolink_phy_uart: Baudrate set to 38400
[00:00:00.000,000] <inf> iolink_demo: Using UART PHY with device: USART_1
```

If the stack logic is running, you will see periodic processing logs or state machine transitions depending on the configured log level and application logic.

## Troubleshooting

- **No output on terminal:** Check if you are connecting to the correct COM port (ST-Link VCP).
- **"UART device not ready" error:** Ensure `usart1` is enabled in the device tree and not conflicting with other peripherals.
- **No communication:** Verify wiring (TX must go to RX). Check if GND is connected common.

## Nucleo-to-Nucleo Test (Standalone)

You can test the IO-Link physical layer using just two Nucleo boards, without a PC master. One board acts as the Device (standard firmware), and the other acts as a simple Master Generator (test firmware).

### 1. Build and Flash the Device (Board A)

This board runs the standard IO-Link Device stack.

```bash
# Build as Device (Default)
west build -p always -b nucleo_l476rg examples/zephyr_app

# Connect Board A and flash
west flash
```

### 2. Build and Flash the Master Generator (Board B)

This board runs a simple loop that sends WakeUp pulses and IDLE frames to test connectivity.

```bash
# Build as Master Generator
west build -p always -b nucleo_l476rg examples/zephyr_app -- -DCONFIG_IOLINK_DEMO_MASTER=y

# Connect Board B and flash
west flash
```

### 3. Verify

Open serial terminals for both boards.

- **Board B (Master)** will print: `Running as DEMO MASTER`, followed by `Master RX: ...` if it receives responses.
- **Board A (Device)** will print: `Starting IO-Link Zephyr Demo`. If wiring is correct, it should eventually synchronize or at least show activity if debug logging is enabled.

> **Note**: This simple Master generator sends dummy 0x55 bytes to simulate WakeUp/IDLE. It does not run a full Master stack, but is sufficient to verify that the physical UART link is working and the Device is receiving data.


## Running with Python Master

You can also test the IO-Link stack on a single Nucleo board by using your PC as the Master via a Python script.

### Prerequisites

- 1x Nucleo L476RG board (flashed with `zephyr_app`)
- Python 3 installed
- `pyserial` library:
    ```bash
    pip install pyserial
    ```

### Wiring

Connect the Nucleo board to your PC via USB. This creates a virtual serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux or `COMx` on Windows).

> **Note:** The `zephyr_app` on the Nucleo is configured to use `usart1` (PA9/PA10) for IO-Link. However, the ST-Link Virtual COM port is usually connected to `usart2` (PA2/PA3).
>
> **To use the USB COM port:** You must either change the overlay to use `usart2` OR use an external USB-TTL adapter connected to PA9/PA10.

### Running the Master

1.  Identify your serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`).
2.  Run the master script:

    ```bash
    python3 tools/virtual_master/nucleo_master.py /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 38400
    ```

3.  The script will attempt to wake up the Device and start the communication cycle.


## Direct-Parameter Requests and Local Process-Data Logging

This procedure shows UART request/response activity and local application updates:

1.  **Device (Board A)**: Increments a simulated sensor value every 2 seconds and updates the IO-Link stack.
2.  **Master (Board B)**: Sends a valid IO-Link Type 0 frame (Read Direct Parameter, Index 0) every 2 seconds to trigger a response.

Type 0 carries no cyclic process-data payload. A local counter-update log does
not prove the master received that counter. Use the runnable Type 2_V
[reference-device simulation](examples/counter.md) for asserted
cyclic data exchange, and a validated transceiver/master setup for physical proof.

### Verification Steps

Run the monitor script:
```bash
python3 examples/zephyr_app/scripts/monitor_nucleos.py --duration 60
```

**Expected Output:**
The Device may report local PD updates and the Master may receive parameter
responses. Inspect the actual frames separately from console logs. VCOM instability
may cause some logs to appear as raw hex or fragmented text.

```text
[DEVICE] Device PD Update: 0x01
[DEVICE] RAW: ... 
...
[DEVICE] Device PD Update: 0x02
```

If console connections drop or logs fragment, check serial-port selection, baud,
power and grounding. Do not infer protocol robustness or the electrical cause
from console output alone; record UART frames and power measurements.
