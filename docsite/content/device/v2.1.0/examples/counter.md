# Counter, button and LED reference device

> Source snapshot: [examples/reference_device/README.md](https://github.com/w1ne/iolinki/blob/ad892f43fa7292cb3d4ccf60410f5541a0d0a5ca/examples/reference_device/README.md), `ad892f43fa72`.


This is runnable software, with a shared C application intended for MCU ports.
The supplied executable uses an in-memory transport and scripted master frames.
It does not exercise a commercial master, transceiver, 24 V line or physical LED.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel 4
./build/examples/reference_device/reference_device_demo
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Run from the repository root. Debian/Ubuntu prerequisites: `cmake`,
`build-essential`, `libcmocka-dev`. The executable returns nonzero on any failed
assertion and prints `SIMULATION PASS` after 100 verified exchanges.

| Direction | Bytes | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device to master | 0, 1 | Unsigned counter, most significant byte first |
| Device to master | 2 | Button: 0 released, 1 pressed |
| Master to device | 0 | Bit 0 controls LED; other bits ignored |

`reference_device_tick()` samples the button, increments the counter with wrap,
publishes input and reads the latest LED command. Call it on an application
sampling schedule, and call `iolink_device_process()` much more frequently to
meet communication timing. The LED reflects the latest output at sampling time.
Do not introduce a one-millisecond sleep into a physical response path.

A button rising edge queues example notification `0x8CA0`. Event acknowledgement
is not demonstrated by this executable. Application tag at index `0x18` can be
written/read using the parameter API; the demo checks local readback, not wire
ISDU transfer. Persistence is disabled in the demo and needs a real NVM backend.

`reference_device.c` uses example identity 1234/5678. These numbers are not an
assignment to your product. Replace identity and hardware revision for your
device, and use manufacturer-assigned identifiers for shipping products.

The demo uses Type 2_V with three input bytes and one output byte, verifies
response framing/checksums, alternates LED output and checks the returned counter.
It disables physical timing enforcement for the host simulation. This does not
justify disabling timing enforcement on hardware.

`device.json` and generated `device.xml` match the three-byte input/one-byte
output map and experimental identity. The example descriptions pass the official XSD and CLI integrity/consistency
checks. See `tools/IODD_GEN.md` for generate/inspect/validate/pack. Your product
identity and the applicable official IODD Checker remain part of product
integration; schema validation does not supply official Checker approval.

See [the TIOL112 integration guide](../tiol112.md) for the reusable
transceiver driver and the remaining MCU work.
